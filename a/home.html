<h1>'Smart Irrigation System- Need of the Hour'</h1>
</body>
<body>
<label> Earlier, India enjoyed abundant water resources. But now, population growth and overexploitation of resources has led to scarcity of water. Main reason behind exploitation of water resources is the traditional system of irrigation. When the soil is moist enough, water is still provided to plants. This excess amount of water is not absorbed by the plants and thus, it is wasted. Same is the case with nutrients too. The nutrient content of the soil (mainly, nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus) is not monitored properly. Thus, the deficiency of the nutrients leads to a lesser yield and lots of plant diseases. So, a smart irrigation system to monitor the water and nutrients requirement of the plants is the need of the hour. This will lead to increase in the crop yield and prevent wastage of water.</label>
